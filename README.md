# Plotting GDP Data on World Map
**Plotting GDP Data on World Map** is the final project of the [Python Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-visualization/home/welcome)course on Coursera platform. It consists of two parts.
* [Part 1](#part1): To link Pygal's map dictionary (mapping 2-letter country codes to country names) to a dictionary that stored World Bank GDP country data keyed by the "Country Name" field and to plot GDP data on world map. 
* [Part 2](#part2): To improve the quality of the world map plots created in Part 1 by creating a better mapping from pygal country codes to World Bank country names.
## Part 1 <a name="part1"></a>
**Part 1** of the project solves the following problems.
1. Creating a dictionary that maps Pygal country codes to World Bank country names (**reconcile_countries_by_name** function).
2. Transforming GDP data for given year into a form suitable for a world map plot (**build_map_dict_by_name** function).
3. Creating an SVG image of the GDP data plotted on the world map (**render_world_map** function).
